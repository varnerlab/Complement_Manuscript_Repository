\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Simplified schematic of the human complement system. The complement cascade is activated through any one, or more, of the three pathways: the classical, the lectin, and the alternate pathways. The classical pathway is activated by the binding of C1 complex through the C1q subunit to the IgG or IgM immune complex. This binding leads to conformational changes in the C1 complex that leads to the activation of C1r and C1s subunits. Activated C1-antibody complex cleaves C4 and C2 to form the classical C3 convertase. The lectin pathway is initiated by the binding mannose-binding lectins (MBL) and ficolins to carbohydrate moieties on the pathogen surfaces. This results in the formation mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs). The MBL-MASP complex cleaves C4 and C2 to form the lectin C3 convertase. The alternative pathway is activated through a spontaneous tick-over mechanism by the hydrolysis of C3 to form fluid phase C3 convertase. The C3 convertases cleaves C3 into C3a, and C3b. C3b combines with C4b and C2a to form classical C5 convertase (C4bC3aC3b). The C3b binds with Factor B to form the alternate C5 convertase (C3bBbC3b) . The C5 convertases cleave C5 into C5a, and C5b that undergoes a series of reactions to form the membrane attack complex (MAC).\relax }}{26}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Reduced order complement model training simulations. Reduced order complement model parameters were estimated using Dynamic Optimization with Particle Swarms (DOPS). The model was trained against experimental data from Shaw and co-workers \cite  {morad2015time} in the presence and absence of zymosan. The model was trained using C3a and C5a data generated from the alternative pathway (\textbf  {A}--\textbf  {B}) and lectin initiated pathway with 1g zymosan (\textbf  {C}--\textbf  {D}). The solid red line shows the simulation with the best-fit parameter, the solid black lines show the simulated mean value of C3a or C5a for 50 independent particles. The dark shaded region denotes 99 \% confidence interval of the simulated mean concentrations of C3a or C5a , while the light shaded region is the 99 \% confidence interval of the best prediction.

The bars denote total sensitivity index which includes local contribution of each parameter and global sensitivity of significant pairwise interactions.

Robustness analysis was conducted on the four cases we used to train our model, C3a alternate (0 zymosan), C5a alternate (0 zymosan), C3a lectin (1 g zymosan), and C5a lectin (1 g zymosan), by reducing the initial concentration of C3 and/or C5 by (A) 50 \% and (B) 90 \%. The bars denote robustness index which a measure of system changes from the perturbation of initial concentration that defined by the ratio of the area under the concentration curve of perturbed case and that of the unperturbed case. The error bars represent one standard deviation. At unity, the perturbed initial concentration has no impact on the measured output, and a robustness index lesser than or greater than one indicates a negative or positive relation between the perturbed initial concentration and the measured output respectively.\relax }}{30}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces  The figure graphically illustrates some of the current complement therapeutics and their targets within our network. A vast majority of the drugs target the terminal pathway by targeting C5 or C5a. Targeting C5 would reduce the formation of C5a and C5b, however targeting C5a directly would reduce the influence of the anaphylatoxin but still produce precursors for the MAC formation. A number of therapeutics also target C3 and the formation of AP C3 convertase through the inhibition of Factors B and D. Finally, very few drugs target complement initiation, this may be due to a need for balance between immunity and inflammation or other complement related diseases. \relax }}{31}}
